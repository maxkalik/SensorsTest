# Sensors Test App

## Main Objective

Write an app which aggregates data from sensors (like gyroscope), gets system info and displays it. No fancy UI is expected, but having good UX would be nice.

## Result

The app will show the data from:

* Accelerometer
* Gyroscope
* Device Motion
* Magnetometer
* Motion Activity
* Pedometer
* Altimeter
* Location
